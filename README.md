**Web-Based Donation Management System for Orphanages**

 Project Description:
The "Web-Based Donation Management System for Orphanages" is an online platform designed to connect donors with orphanages efficiently and transparently. The system allows individuals and organizations to donate food, clothing, and money to orphanages based on real-time needs posted by the institutions. 

Through a user-friendly interface, donors can browse available donation requests, select items or causes they wish to support, and complete donations online. The system includes features like donor registration, orphanage registration, real-time donation tracking, request management, donation history, and automated receipts. 

Admin panels are provided for orphanages to post specific requirements (e.g., "need 100 sets of winter clothes" or "monthly grocery supplies"), while donors can track how their contributions are utilized. The platform ensures transparency, encourages frequent contributions, and fosters stronger community support for orphaned children.
